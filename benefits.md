#Benefits over Flattr: 

##Cheaper
	* Flattr charges a flat 10% rate on every tip. PLUS payment processors charge a fee to withdraw.
	* Bitcoin charges ~1 penny for every tip.  
	* Cheaper for anything over 10 cents if you stay in bitcoin. 
	* Over 10x cheaper for anything over $1.  
	* Over 100 times cheaper for anything over $10.

	* Even with the fluctuating value of bitcoin, it's still cheaper if the value of bitcoin falls 9% in a month on average.
	* Even with the bitcoin conversion costs, it still might be cheaper.  
	* Coinbase only charges ~1% to buy/sell bitcoin.  This is cheaper than flattr's payment processors.

##Faster
	* Flattr only processes tips once a month.  With bitcoin, you can cash out a tip at your convenience.
	* The user can tip more frequently (daily/weekly).  You can get a steady stream based on activity rather than once a month. Users can set daily or weekly budgets instead of just monthly.

##More Private
	* No one but you knows what you have tipped. 
	* You don't have to link your credit card identity to a list of things that you financially support.
	* There's also no list of things that you have financially supported in the first place.

##No Minimums
    * With Flattr you must deposit at least 5 EUR.
	* You can only withdraw 10 EUR or more.
	
##Decentralized
	* Bitcoin requires no Sign Up.
	* There are no Terms of Use.
	* Your account can not be frozen.
	
##Total Freedom
	* Flattr doesn't allow you to withdraw money you have already deposited.
	* With bitcoin, you can withdraw at any time.  Or you can use the bitcoins you have to just buy things without another conversion fee.
